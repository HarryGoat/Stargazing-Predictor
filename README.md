#### Description: CS50 Final Project. I have made an web based application which makes use of data, retrieved by API calls, and uses it to display a score out of 100 for the sky quality. It takes into account moon phase, humidity and cloud cover. I have accomplished this by making use of tRPC, using typescript, for server side and client side interactions.
